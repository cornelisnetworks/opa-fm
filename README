OPA Fabric Manager
-------------------

* To build the RPM and SRPM:

  1. mkdir -p $HOME/rpmbuild/{SOURCES,RPMS,SRPMS}
  
  2. tar czf $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES/opa-fm-v`grep Version opa-fm.fedora.spec | awk '{print $2}'`.tar.gz --exclude-vcs .
     OR
     Download tar ball from https://github.com/cornelisnetworks/opa-fm/releases
     and place in $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES

     !!
     Ensure Version tag in spec file matches the tarball
     !!


  3. rpmbuild -ba ./opa-fm.fedora.spec

  This will build the opa-fm RPM in $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS(architecture)/

  This will also create a opa-fm-debuginfo RPM, which by default contains basic
  symbol information - see blow on how to build with full debugging information.

* To build in this directory:

1. cd Esm; ./fmbuild


* How to include debugging symbols:

  export BUILD_CONFIG=debug

  prior to either of the aforementioned build procedures.


 * To update GitHub

	Pre: Update spec file to reflect new version

	1. Push internal development tree + spec file changes to public GH repo

	2. Create a "Release"/tag with the format: opa-fm-v{version}
