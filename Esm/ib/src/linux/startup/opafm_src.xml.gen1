  <!-- Various sets of Applications which may be used in Virtual Fabrics -->
  <!-- Applications defined here are available for use in all FM instances. -->
  <!-- Additional Applications may be defined here or per FM instance. -->
  <!-- Applications specified per FM instance will add to -->
  <!-- instead of replace these Application definitions. -->
  <Applications>
    <!-- Each Application can have one or more ServiceIDs and/or MGIDs. -->
    <!-- These will be matched against PathRecord and Multicast SA queries -->
    <!-- so that the returned SLID/DLID, PKey, SL, etc are appropriate for -->
    <!-- the Virtual Fabric(VF) which contains the application(s). -->

    <!-- Every Application must have a unique <Name> -->
    <!-- The name must be unique among all Application names within an -->
    <!-- FM instance. -->
    <!-- When defined at Common level must be unique within all instances. -->
    <!-- The name is limited to 64 characters and is case sensitive. -->

    <!-- ServiceIDs are 64 bit values which identify applications within the -->
    <!-- PathRecord query and are typically used within the InfiniBand -->
    <!-- Communication Manager (CM) protocol to identify the application for -->
    <!-- a connection request. -->
    <!-- In many ways ServiceIDs are IBs equivalent of TCP "socket ports". -->
    <!-- ServiceIDs can be specified in the following ways in the -->
    <!-- Application section: -->
    <!-- a single ServiceID: <ServiceID>0x1234567812345678</ServiceID> -->
    <!-- a range of ServiceIDs: -->
    <!---       <ServiceIDRange>0-0xffffffffffffffff</ServiceIDRange> -->

    <!--        Matches ServiceIDs which when ANDed with 2nd value (the -->
    <!--        mask) match the 1st value -->
    <!-- all others not in any VF: <Select>UnmatchedServiceID</Select> -->
    <!--        UnmatchedServiceID matches all applications' ServiceIDs -->
    <!--        which match none of the Virtual Fabrics after filtering -->
    <!--        by src/dest/requester. -->
    <!--        Can be used as an easy catch-all. -->

    <!-- MGIDs (IB Multicast GIDs) are 128 bit values which identify -->
    <!-- multicast groups for Unreliable Datagram applications such as IPoIB -->
    <!-- MGIDs are represented as two 64 bit values separated by a colon (:) -->
    <!-- This way of representing 128 bit values is the same as used in  -->
    <!-- other FastFabric Tools such as opasaquery, opashowmc, etc. -->
    <!-- MGIDs can be specified in the following ways in the Application -->
    <!-- section: -->
    <!-- a single MGID: <MGID>0xabc:0x123567</MGID> -->
    <!-- a range of MGIDs: -->
    <!--        <MGIDRange>0:0-0xffffffffffffffff:0xffffffffffffffff</MGIDRange> -->

    <!--        Matches MGIDs which when ANDed with 2nd value (the -->
    <!--        mask) match the 1st value. -->
    <!-- all others not in any VF: <Select>UnmatchedMGID</Select> -->
    <!--        UnmatchedMGID matches all applications' MGIDs which match -->

    <!--        src/dest/requester. -->
    <!--        Can be used as an easy catch-all -->

    <!-- A special case is SA queries.  This special "application" allows -->
    <!-- SA query operations to be assigned to an appropriate VF.  -->
    <!-- SA queries must use the default Partition Key (0x7fff or 0xffff). -->
    <!-- However other aspects of SA access can be controlled (SL, etc). -->
    <!-- This syntax allows an Application to be specified which includes -->
    <!-- SA queries: <Select>SA</Select> -->

    <!--     the wire depth returned in the port info. If not specified, -->
    <!--     defaults to -1. -->
    <!--     A value of -1 indicates to use the value from port info. -->
    <!--     A value of 0 means to ignore Wire Depth, and use Replay Depth. -->
