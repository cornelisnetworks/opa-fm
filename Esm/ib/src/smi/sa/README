	1 = Required / Optional
	2 = Record Attribute (Yes / No)
	3 = Configuration
	4 = State

	 RID = <LID><PORTNO><INDEX>
	URID = <anything>

	PORTNO = 0 for CA and routers (affects the input port only)

	For example, GUIDInfo RA for CA port with LID=5 would have RID = 0x000500nn.
	(Because the index can vary since there are multiple GUIDInfos.)
